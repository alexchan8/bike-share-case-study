# bike-share-case-study

This case study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate program. In this project, I took on the role of a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago. The primary objective was to analyze historical bike usage data in order to uncover trends and behavioral differences between casual riders and annual members. The ultimate goal was to develop actionable, data-driven marketing strategies to help the company convert more casual riders into long-term subscribers.

Throughout the case study, I followed the six-step data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. I worked with real-world bike-share data, performed data cleaning and transformation, and conducted exploratory analysis using tools like Excel and Tableau. I identified key patterns in user behavior, such as ride frequency, trip duration, popular usage times, and demographic trends. These insights informed a set of marketing recommendations aimed at increasing user engagement and boosting subscription rates.

This project not only helped me strengthen my technical skills in data manipulation and visualization but also allowed me to practice translating data into meaningful business insights that support strategic decision-making.
